# **Sentiment-Analysis**
* **Overview** 

    This project focuses on entity-level sentiment analysis using a Twitter dataset.
    This project determine the sentiment of messages in relation to specific entities, classifying them as Positive, Negative, Neutral, or Irrelevant. Through this project, we aim to apply machine learning techniques to accurately predict the sentiment behind each tweet, enhancing the ability of businesses and organizations to better understand and respond to the publicâ€™s sentiment toward their entities in real time. The project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text data and multiple machine learning models to classify the messages. The final application includes a deployment built with streamlit for ease of use.

* **Features**

  -Message Classification:Classify messages as Positive, Negative, Neutral, or Irrelevant.

  -Multiple ML Algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Descision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF). 

  -Deployment: User-friendly GUI for inputting messages and displaying results.

* **Technologies Used**

  Programming Language: Python Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), streamlit (for deployment),
