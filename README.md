 The goal is to determine the sentiment of messages in relation to specific entities, classifying them as Positive, Negative, Neutral, or Irrelevant.
 Through this project, we aim to apply machine learning techniques to accurately predict the sentiment behind each tweet, enhancing the ability of businesses and organizations to better understand and respond to the publicâ€™s sentiment toward their entities in real time.
